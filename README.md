# Project: vehicles_insight

## Objective

The script vehicles.py takes a Pandas DataFrame as argument and returns:
- Shape of the dataframe in format:  (number of rows, number of columns)
- Number of rows in the dataframe
- Array with the column labels

## Requirements

Pandas and numpy modules needs to be installed previously.
Only one dataframe at a time is supported. Do not pass more than one argument.

## How to use it

The script defines the function and it includes an example.
You can either:
- Open the script file with a text editor and replace the dataframe
- After running the script, you can call the function my_func passing the dataframe as argument.
